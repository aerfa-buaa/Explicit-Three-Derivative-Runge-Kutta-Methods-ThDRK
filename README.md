# Explicit-Three-Derivative-Runge-Kutta-Methods-ThDRK
This work is the result for our article[1] and builds the order accuracy conditions for Three-Derivative Runge-Kutta Methods (ThDRK). There are two devices to build the order conditions for Runge-Kutta methods: rooted trees[2] and Albrecht's approach[3]. The code file shows the order accuracy conditions for ThDRK by Albrecht's approach, and verified the coefficients are equivalent for the conditions by rooted trees theory[4].
